The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, which can then be applied to new, unseen data. Supervised learning is further divided into two main categories:</p> <ul><li>Classification: The task of assigning input data into one of several predefined classes. For example, an email spam filter classifies emails as &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;not spam.&quot;</li> <li>Regression: The task of predicting a continuous value. For instance, predicting the price of a house based on its features.</li></ul> <h2 id="unsupervised-learning"><a href="#unsupervised-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Unsupervised Learning</h2> <p>Unsupervised Learning, on the other hand, involves training a model without any labeled data. The model is left to discover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data on its own. This approach is particularly useful when there are no clear labels or when the goal is to understand the underlying structure of the data. Unsupervised learning includes:</p> <ul><li>Clustering: The process of grouping similar data points together. For example, grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior.</li> <li>Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of random variables to consider without losing much information. This can be useful for visualizing high-dimensional data or improving the performance of machine learning models.
Anomaly Detection: Identifying data points that do not conform to expected patterns, which can be useful for detecting fraud or system anomalies.</li></ul> <p>In summary, supervised learning relies on labeled data to make predictions, while unsupervised learning seeks to uncover hidden patterns without any prior knowledge of what the correct output should be.</p> <h2 id="semi-supervised-learning"><a href="#semi-supervised-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Semi-supervised learning</h2> <p>Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm that combines both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance of learning algorithms. It is particularly useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, but a large amount of unlabeled data is available. The goal is to leverage the structure and patterns present in the unlabeled data to enhance the learning process.</p> <p>Semi-supervised learning has many methods, one can split</p> <h3 id="pseudo-label"><a href="#pseudo-label" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pseudo label</h3> <p>Pseudo label semi-supervised learning is a technique used in machine learning, particularly in the field of computer vision, to improve the performance of models by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. Here's a brief overview:</p> <h4 id="concept"><a href="#concept" class="header-anchor">#</a> Concept</h4> <p>In semi-supervised learning, you have a limited amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Pseudo label semi-supervised learning involves training a model on the labeled data and then using the model to predict labels for the unlabeled data. These predicted labels, or pseudo labels, are then used to augment the training set.</p> <ul><li><p>Pseudo Labels: The model's predictions on the unlabeled data are not perfect and may contain errors. However, they can still provide useful information, especially for confident predictions. Pseudo labels are typically filtered or refined to reduce noise before being used.</p></li> <li><p>Iterative Process: The process can be iterative. After augmenting the training set with pseudo labels, the model is retrained. This updated model can then be used to generate new pseudo labels, which can further improve the model's performance.</p></li> <li><p>Advantages: This approach can significantly improve the performance of a model compared to using only the limited labeled data. It is particularly useful in scenarios where obtaining labels is expensive or time-consuming.</p></li> <li><p>Challenges: The main challenge is the risk of propagating errors from the initial model's predictions. To mitigate this, methods like self-training, co-training, and multi-view learning are often employed to increase the confidence in the pseudo labels.</p></li></ul> <h4 id="applications"><a href="#applications" class="header-anchor">#</a> Applications</h4> <p>Pseudo label semi-supervised learning is widely used in image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks where large amounts of unlabeled data are available.</p> <p>Recent Developments: With the rise of deep learning, techniques like transfer learning and ensemble methods have been integrated into pseudo label semi-supervised learning to further improve results. Additionally, there has been research into using uncertainty measures to guide the selection of pseudo labels.</p> <p>In summary, pseudo label semi-supervised learning is a powerful tool for training models with limited labeled data, by leveraging the potential of unlabeled data through pseudo labeling and iterative refinement.</p> <h3 id="weak-supervised-learning"><a href="#weak-supervised-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Weak-supervised learning</h3> <p>Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) is a subfield of machine learning that deals with the scenario where the available labels for training data are incomplete, ambiguous, or of lower quality compared to fully supervised learning. In fully supervised learning, each training example is associated with a precise label. However, in real-world applications, obtaining such high-quality labels can be time-consuming, expensive, or even impossible. WSL aims to make the best use of limited or imperfect label information to train models that can generalize well to unseen data.</p> <ul><li><p>Data Labels: The labels in WSL are often in the form of partial annotations, such as image-level labels where a whole image is labeled instead of individual objects within it, or labels that are generated through heuristics rather than precise manual annotations.</p></li> <li><p>Learning Strategies: WSL employs various strategies to learn from weak labels, including:</p></li> <li><p>Self-training: The model is initially trained on the weakly labeled data and then used to predict labels for the same data. The most confident predictions are added back into the training set, and the process is repeated iteratively.</p></li> <li><p>Co-training: Two or more models are trained on different views of the data. They are used to label each other's unlabeled data, and the most confident predictions are added to the training set.
Multi-instance learning: This approach is used when each training instance is a collection of items (e.g., a bag of words in text), and each bag is labeled as a whole. The goal is to infer the labels of the individual items within the bag.</p></li> <li><p>Label propagation: This involves propagating labels from labeled instances to their nearest neighbors in the feature space.
Applications: WSL is particularly useful in areas where manual labeling is challenging, such as image classification, natural language processing, and bioinformatics, where expert annotations are expensive or difficult to obtain.</p></li></ul> <h4 id="challenges"><a href="#challenges" class="header-anchor">#</a> Challenges</h4> <p>WSL faces several challenges, including:</p> <ul><li><p>Noise in Labels: Weak labels can introduce noise, which can degrade the performance of the learning algorithm.
Ambiguity: Weak labels may not capture the nuances of the data, leading to ambiguity in the learning process.
Model Complexity: WSL models often need to be more complex to handle the uncertainty in the labels and to learn from the limited information.
Research Directions: Researchers are exploring various techniques to improve WSL, such as:</p></li> <li><p>Active Learning: Selecting the most informative instances for labeling to reduce the labeling effort while maintaining high performance.
Transfer Learning: Leveraging knowledge from related tasks or domains to improve learning from weak labels.
Learning with Uncertainty: Developing methods that can explicitly model and handle the uncertainty in weak labels.
Weakly-supervised learning is an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to develop more robust and efficient algorithms that can effectively learn from imperfect data.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="self-supervised-learning"><a href="#self-supervised-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Self-supervised learning</h3> <p>Self-supervised learning is a subset of unsupervised learning that involves training models using unlabeled data by leveraging the structure and patterns within the data itself. It's a powerful technique that can be used to learn useful representations that can then be applied to various downstream tasks, such as classification, object detection, or natural language processing.</p> <h4 id="concept-2"><a href="#concept-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Concept:</h4> <p>The core idea is to create a pretext task that generates a form of supervision signal from the data itself, without the need for human-annotated labels. This pretext task is designed to learn something useful about the data that can generalize to other tasks.</p> <ul><li><p>Pretext Tasks: These are tasks that are designed to learn useful features. Examples include predicting the next frame in a video, reconstructing corrupted parts of an image, or predicting masked tokens in a text sequence. These tasks are chosen to encourage the model to learn features that are invariant to transformations or perturbations.</p></li> <li><p>Learning Process: Models are trained on large datasets using these pretext tasks. The model learns to solve the pretext task, and in doing so, it captures useful features that can be transferred to other tasks.</p></li> <li><p>Transfer Learning: Once the model has been trained on the pretext task, it can be fine-tuned on a specific task using labeled data. The features learned during the self-supervised phase often provide a strong starting point, leading to improved performance compared to models trained from scratch.</p></li> <li><p>Advantages: Self-supervised learning can be advantageous because it can make use of vast amounts of unlabeled data, which is often more readily available than labeled data. It can also help overcome the limitations of supervised learning, such as the need for large amounts of labeled data and the risk of overfitting to the specific labels provided.</p></li></ul> <h4 id="applications-2"><a href="#applications-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Applications</h4> <p>Self-supervised learning has been applied in various domains, including computer vision (e.g., image classification, object detection), natural language processing (e.g., language modeling, machine translation), and speech recognition.</p> <h4 id="challenges-2"><a href="#challenges-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Challenges</h4> <p>Despite its benefits, self-supervised learning also faces challenges, such as designing effective pretext tasks, ensuring that the learned representations are truly useful for the target tasks, and dealing with the potential for the model to learn spurious correlations that don't generalize well.</p> <p>Self-supervised learning is an active area of research, and new methods and applications continue to emerge, making it a promising approach for training deep learning models in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.</p> <h2 id="others"><a href="#others" class="header-anchor">#</a> Others</h2> <h3 id="inductive-learning"><a href="#inductive-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Inductive Learning</h3> <p>Inductive learning, also known as generalization, is the process where a learning algorithm makes broad predictions or decisions based on a limited set of observations. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict outcomes for new, unseen data points. This is achieved by finding patterns or rules from the training data that are general enough to apply to new instances.</p> <ul><li><p>Examples: Supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled data to make predictions on new, unlabeled data, is a classic example of inductive learning. Other examples include decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines.</p></li> <li><p>Challenges: Overfitting can be a problem in inductive learning, where the model becomes too specialized to the training data and fails to generalize well to new data.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="transductive-learning"><a href="#transductive-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Transductive Learning</h3> <p>Transductive learning is a hybrid approach that lies between inductive and deductive learning. It involves making predictions directly on the target data points without the need for explicit generalization to unseen data. In this case, the model is trained on both labeled and unlabeled data, and the goal is to make predictions on the specific unlabeled instances.</p> <ul><li><p>Examples: Semi-supervised learning is a common form of transductive learning, where a model is trained on a small set of labeled data and a larger set of unlabeled data, and the model is used to make predictions on the unlabeled data.</p></li> <li><p>Benefits: Transductive learning can be beneficial when labeled data is scarce, as it leverages the information from the unlabeled data to improve the predictions on the target instances.</p></li> <li><p>Challenges: One of the challenges is that the model may not generalize well to new, unseen data points that are significantly different from the training data.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="meta-learning"><a href="#meta-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Meta-learning</h3> <p>Meta-learning, also known as learning to learn, is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on algorithms that can learn how to learn from a series of tasks or datasets. The goal is to develop models that can quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal data, by leveraging the knowledge gained from previous tasks. Meta-learning can be broadly categorized into three main approaches:</p> <ol><li><p>Learning a Model:
This approach involves training a model to perform well on a variety of tasks. The model learns to generalize across tasks, so that it can quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal additional training. This is often achieved through techniques like neural architecture search, where the model learns to construct its own architecture that is optimal for the task at hand.</p></li> <li><p>Learning to Learn:
In this approach, the focus is on learning a set of strategies or algorithms that can be applied to new tasks. The model does not directly learn the solution to the task but learns how to learn the solution. This is similar to a teacher who learns how to teach effectively, rather than memorizing the content of all possible lessons.</p></li> <li><p>Learning a Prior:
This method involves learning a prior distribution over the space of possible tasks. When faced with a new task, the model uses this prior to guide its learning process. Bayesian methods are often used here, where the prior represents the model's belief about the task's parameters before any data is seen.</p></li></ol> <h4 id="key-techniques-in-meta-learning"><a href="#key-techniques-in-meta-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Key Techniques in Meta-learning:</h4> <ul><li><p>Few-Shot Learning: This is a specific instance of meta-learning where the model is trained to learn from very few examples. It's particularly useful in situations where data is scarce or expensive to obtain.</p></li> <li><p>Transfer Learning: This technique involves transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain. The model is first trained on a related task and then fine-tuned on the target task, often with a smaller amount of data.</p></li> <li><p>Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning: This approach aims to develop a meta-learning algorithm that is independent of the specific model architecture. It focuses on learning a set of hyperparameters or initializations that can improve the performance of any model on a new task.</p></li> <li><p>Neural Network Meta-Learning: This involves training neural networks with architectures that are designed to adapt quickly to new tasks. Examples include learning rate adaptation, weight initialization schemes, and architectures that can dynamically grow or shrink based on the task.</p></li></ul> <h4 id="applications-of-meta-learning"><a href="#applications-of-meta-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Applications of Meta-learning:</h4> <p>Meta-learning has applications in various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and reinforcement learning. It's particularly useful in scenarios where the data distribution changes frequently, such as in online learning or when dealing with non-stationary environments.</p> <p>In summary, meta-learning is a field that seeks to create intelligent systems capable of rapidly adapting to new tasks by learning from past experiences. It's a promising area of research with the potential to revolutionize how machine learning models are trained and deployed.</p> <h3 id="in-context-learning"><a href="#in-context-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> In-context learning</h3> <p>In-context learning is a term used in the field of machine learning, particularly in the context of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. It refers to the ability of a model to learn and adapt its behavior based on the specific context in which it is being used, rather than relying solely on pre-trained knowledge.</p> <p>In traditional machine learning, models are often trained on large datasets and then applied to new, unseen data. However, in many real-world scenarios, the context in which a model operates can significantly affect its performance. For example, the meaning of a word can change based on the surrounding words (collocations), or the appropriate response to a user's query can depend on the conversation history.</p> <p>In-context learning models are designed to be more flexible and adaptable. They can incorporate new information from the current context to make more accurate predictions or decisions. This is often achieved by fine-tuning a pre-trained model with a smaller amount of data that is specific to the task at hand, or by using techniques like transfer learning, where the model learns from a related task and then applies that knowledge to the new task.</p> <p>One of the challenges with in-context learning is ensuring that the model does not overfit to the specific examples it encounters, which could lead to poor generalization to new, unseen contexts. To address this, researchers and developers often use techniques like regularization and carefully designed training strategies.</p> <p>In-context learning is particularly relevant in areas like conversational AI, where the model needs to understand and respond appropriately to a user's requests in a dynamic and conversational setting. It's also important in tasks where the model needs to adapt to new domains or languages with minimal additional training data.</p> <!----></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/KehanPang/edit/main/docs/knowledge/Sundry/02-MLmethod.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit this page</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last update in:</span> <span class="time">9/16/2024, 11:54:19 PM</span></div></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
